In the next place I have made ita constant study to
keep as close to the Latin order as possible, still under
the imperative condition that in no case should English

been surprised to see how far the order of the original
could be imitated in a translation. I have tried to
impart to my version a slight poetical ssavor, but without

instances; I remember only the poetic contractions der,

but of poetry.

Finally l have essayed the much harder task‚ following
the example of Professer Palmer, of translating into rhyth- ,

do always, consistently with fidelity to principles which I
have. already stated and which Ι deemed of paramount
importance. The splendid achievement of Professor
Palmer in his translation of the Odyssey could, alas! do
nemore for mc than prompt me to try to imitate him ; it
could not give wings to leaden feet. If Professor Palmer

Ihave said that Ι found this seventh book the most
difficult one of the whole Aeneid. I do not mean diffi-
