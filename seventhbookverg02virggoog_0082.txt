THE AENEID, V11. 53

Nursia sent, and the Ortinian troops, and the Latin
tribes; those whom the Allia, ill-starred name,
divides and flows between, as many as the billows
that roll along the Lybian sea, when stormy Orion
hides his iace in the wintry waves‚ or as the thick-
standing heads of grain, when they are parched by 720
the summer sun in the plain oi Hermus or in the
golden fields of Lycia. Shields ring and Earth is
startled with the tramp oi feet.

Next Halaesus, friend of Agamemnon, and ioe ol
the Trojan name, yokes his horses to his car, and
to aid Turnus hurries on a thousand fierce elans: 725
those who till the vineclad Massic heights, and
those whom the Auruncan fathers sent from the high
hills 3 and the dwellers in the Sidicinian plains hard
by; those, too,- who leave Cales or dwell by the
bank of Vulturnus’ shallow stream, alike the rough
Saticulan and the bands ol the Osci. Smooth darts 730
are their weapons, but these it is their custom to fit
with pliant thong3 atarget covers their leit hand;
scythe-shaped their swords for close encounter.

Nor shalt thou be left unsung by lays of mine,
Oebalus, born, 'tis said, to Telon by anaiad oi the
Sebethus, while he held sway o'er Capreae, the 735
realm of the Teleboans‚ when now advanced in
years3 but the son, not likewise content with the
dominion oi his father, was even then curbing under
his sway the wide-spread Sarrastes, and ruling the
plains which the Sarnus waters‚ with the people who
hold Rufrae and Batulum and the lands of Celemna,
and those whom the city of apple-bearing Abella 740
sees beneath her, all wont to hurl the boomerang in
the Teuton way; the covering of their heads was
bark stripped from the cork-tree3 of bronze their

gleaming bucklerS, of bronze the gleaming sword.
Thee too, Ufens, did Nersae mid the hills send
