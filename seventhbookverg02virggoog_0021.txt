X INTRODUCTORY NOTE. ,

given does not indicate the construction ol the original,

and also in reference to the study of words; partly ina
criticism of the translation3 that is, in such inquiries aa
“Why was this form of expression chosen ? '' “Why this
order?'’ “Why was the construction of the Latin not
followed here? ” “ How would the rhythmical character of
this sentence be affected by the substitution of this o'r
that word? ” “How is the force of this Latin suffix con·
veyed?'' “Does the Latin contain all that is expressed
in the translation ? '² “ Is anything in the Latin lost in the
translation?'' Such an examination will surely sharpen
the insight and appreciation, improve the taste‚ and
beget a wholesome dislike of crude and slovenly versions.

Drill in syntax should be allowed to sleep for a
time and many points be permitted to pass unnoticed
that might easily invite discussion. A class should be
able to take double the ordinary lesson, and when the
book has been completed in this way, it should be rapidly
reviewed without the accompanying translation, and the
only work required should be the metrical reading of the

text and an independent version by the student. Inde-
pendent‚ but not too insistently independent, since not a

little of the translation studied will remain in the memory.
It is notos course to be expected or required of the pupil
that he shall translate into rhythmical prose ; but it is to
be hoped that much reading aloud ol the translation sup
plied will cultivate the ear and insensibly give aieeling
for cadence that will aflect the choice ol words and forms
