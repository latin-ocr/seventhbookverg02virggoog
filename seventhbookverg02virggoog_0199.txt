THIS edition includes thirteen orations arranged chronologi·
cally, and covering the entire public liic oi Cicero. The intro· ξ

ductions connect the orations, and, with thern, supply a complete ἢ
historical study of this most interesting and eventful period. The l
Life of Cicero, List of his Writings, and chronological Tahle will ἦ

be found of great value. The orations are: Deience of Rosciae,

Impeachment of Verres (Tte Plnnder of Syracuse aad Crucifiaion η
of a Roman Cirizen), The Manilian Law, the four orations against ,

Catilina, For Archias, For Sestius, For Milo, The Pardon oi Mar·
callus, For Ligarius, and the Fourteenth Philippie.

The notes have been thoroughly rewritten in the light oi the
most recent investigatione and the best experience of the class- ’

room. Topics oi special importance, as, for instance, the Antiqui·

ties, are given full treatment in brief essays or excursuses, printed ἵ
in small type. References are given to the grammars of Allan& 3

Greenough, Gildersleere, and Harhness.
