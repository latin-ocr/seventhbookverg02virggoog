stances; but it is at least possible to lay great emphasis
upon translation, and a detailed and critical study of
,translation is the best possible way to foster a literary
sense and cultivate literary judgment.

It is true that the way to leam to do a thing is to do
it, and not merely to see it done. Hence boys and girls
must practice translation a great deal. But they can
also leam much from the study oi good models; and Ι
think teachers hardly have a right to complain oi the
eternal baldness of the translations of their pupils, so
long as they deny them acccss to the best models‚ and do
not daily show them by their own performance to what

they would have them aspire in form and diction. I
have come to believe that both means are necessary-

irequent translations hythe teacher, especially to embody
and eniorce criticisms of daily lessons, and a certain
amount of detailed study of the best printed translations.
Oi the latter, the study oi a single book oi the Aeneid,
ior example, or of the Iliad or Odyssey, or of a single
oration of Cicero, may be enough. A learner should
have a clear notion of what a good translation is and of
the principles on which it should be worked out. ΙΙ to
thisbe added the inspiration oi the teacher's example,
I know not what more can be done.
