Lee many more; but from none of these do I remember
appropriating an entire sentence. But whoever makes a
detailed comparison of my version with Conington’s prose
translation, will see that my obligations to him are by no
means small. Ol course a great many verbal coin-
cidences are accidental. Iwould gladly have aeknowl-
edged all explicit appropriations and adaptations, but
such a course, besides being impraeticable‚ would convey
an erroneouS, because inadequate, impression. How can
one indicate the many subtle suggestions that spring from
a minute aud prolonged comparison and balancing ol
one's own forms ot expression with the text of the
original and with another’s renderings?

On the other hand I ought not to exaggerate my in-
debtedness to Conington. His prose translation ol the
seventh book of the Aeneid ends with line 640, thus
covering onlya little more than three fourths ol the book.
Iam not able to see that my translation of this omitted

fourth falls below the other parts iri which Ι had the aid
of Conington. '

l now commit'my completed task to the searching
criticism and judgment of my fellow-teachers. ll it does ·
not prove uselul in the way l intended, it may prove not
without helpful suggestiveness
