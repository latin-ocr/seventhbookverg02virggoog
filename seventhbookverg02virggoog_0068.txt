THE AENEID, VII.

baleful goddess, from her lookout discovering the
moment for mischiel, wings her way to the steep
root ol a hut and from the highest peak sounds the
shepherds' signal, straining forth on crooked horn a
hellish blast, whereat at once all the wood trembled
and the forests echoed to their inmost depths. The 5¹5
lake ol Trivia heard it far away, the river Nar, white
with sulphurous stream heard it, and the waters of
Velinus, and terror-stricken mothers pressed their
children to their breasts.

formed3 no longer in a rustic' contest is the battle
waged with heavy clubs and charred stakes, but with
two-edged steel they fight, and all around, the dark 525
corn-land bristles with drawn swords and their
bronze arms gleam, smltten by the sun, llinging

voice with blood and stopped the slender lile. Here
and there lie many fallen heroes; old Galaesus 535
too, falls as he throws himself between the hosts
to plead lor peace-Galaesus, the one most just
and then richest in Ausonian lands. *Five flocks of

bleating sheep, all his, five herds used to come back
from pasture; his land he turned with a hundred

ploughs
