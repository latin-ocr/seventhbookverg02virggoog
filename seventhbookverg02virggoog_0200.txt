THE selectione were chosen with a view to making the study 01
Latin interesting. Most oi them are from the Metamorphoses,
01 which about one-third has been taken. By help 01 the argu·
ment, which is given in iuli, the editor has endeavored to put
before the reader something like a complete picture 01 the Greek
mythology, at least 01 those narratives which have held their
permanent place in the modern mind and have entered more or

less into every modern literature.

Professor Greenough's vocabulary‚ similar in style and character to
’ his Caesar, Cicero, aud Virgil vocabularies, adds greatly to the valuc
nithe edition, and the illustretious will be found truly illustrative.
