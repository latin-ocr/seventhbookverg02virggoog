THE AENEID, VIl. 23

with his message the followers ol Aeneas return
mounted and with high hearts bringing back a mes· 285
sage ol peace.

But lo! returning lrom Inachian Argos there was
the cruel wile of Jove, even now holding on her way
lightly through the air. From the distant sky, even
from above Sicilian PachynuS, she discerns glad-
hearted Aeneas and the Dardan fleet. She sees how ·

of the Lapithae. The father of the gods himself 305
gave up ancient Calydon to the vengeance of Diana.
For what crime deserved the Lapithae or Calydon
such vengeance? But l, Jove's great consort, who
have stooped without success to dare all, who have
turned to every shift, am overcome by Aeneas! But
