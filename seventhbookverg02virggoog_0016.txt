PREFACE. V

would have them d0, without break to the end. This Ι
have done ior reasons that have already been indicated
—as a means oi repeating and summing up points touch·
ing the meaning and mode of rendering, and also as the
best way to throw into darker relief faults of translation
that are most incorrigible and deplorable, ifhaply I may
make some a little unhappy over their own too literal, bald,
and anti-poetical versions.

In this practise I have found the seventh book ol the
Aeneid much the most difficolt oi the whole poem, and
that first suggested to me the desirableness oi writing out
a translation lor my own use; further reflection led me
to think that by publishing it Ι might do a service to
studente and teachers of Vergil.

lt will not require many words to explain the principles
on which this translation has been made. It was not at
all my aim to make what is generally understood by a
“literal '’ translation, i. c. a translation in which the syn-
tactical structure of the original is, so iar as possible,
scrupulously and rigorously reflected. Whatever raison
d'btre such translations may have, the use oi them by
boys and girls is sure to foster laziness and weaken seli·
reliance. Still less had Ι any purpose of making what is
called a “ free '’ translation, interpolating or suppressing,
expanding or retrenching, at my own pleasure or con-
venience. I have sought everywhere and always to
express the exact meaning of the original as rigorously
as would be done in the most literal version, without
addition for the sake oi ornament, or omission or
obscurity for the sake of evading a difficulty. But I
have tried to do this without offenee to the purity of “
English idiom.
