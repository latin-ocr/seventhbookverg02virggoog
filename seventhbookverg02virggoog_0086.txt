THE AENElD, Vll. 57

Styx. ⁵ But kind Trivia hides Hippolytus in her own

haunts and commits him to the nymph Egeria and 775
her grove, that there alone, in Italian woods, unknown

to fame he may pass his lire and with changed name

be Virbius.1 Whence still from Trivia’s temple and

the sacred grove horn-hoofed horses are kept away3
because, scared by monsters from the sea, they
dashed to ruin chariot and hero on the shore. Yet 780
none the less guided the son his fiery steeds along

the level of the plain and in his chariot rushed to
war.

Turnus himself, of beauteous form moves with
arms in hand among the foremost and overtops
them by a whole head. His towering helmet with
three-sold crest oi hair bears a Chimaera breathing 785
forth fires oi Aetna from her jaws, raging and wild
with baleful flames so much the more, the more
fiercely waxes the cnsanguined fight. But his smooth
shield bore lor emblem an Io with uplifted horns
in gold, now a heifer, clothed with hair, a wondrous 790
' device; and ArguS, watcher of the maid, and father
Inachus pouring out a river from a chased urn. Him
follows a cloud of mar'ching men, and hosts armed
with shields crowd all the plains, Argivo braveS,
Aruncan bandS, Rutuli and Sicanians of ancient 795
stock, Sacranian ranks and Labici with painted
shields: they who plough thy gladeS, Tiber, and the ·
sacred shore of Numicius, and vex with the share the
Rutulian hills and Circe’s height; and the land over
which Jupiter Anxurus watches, and Feronia delight-
ing in her green grove, where lies the gloomy lake 800
of Satura, and where the cold Ufens seeks a way
through the lowest vales and buries itself in the
sea.

¹ Servius would make the name refer to his being restored to life3
he was Vir bis!
