NOWt that the Baginner's Lat' tm Book has been before the public

nearly six years, the publishers are able to say without hesita-
tion that it has been far more successful than any other introduc-
tory Latin book ever published in this country. This remarkable

result is due to a combination of excellences so skilfully blended
that effeots are more patent than causes. While the book may be
used as an introduction to Caesm, it is more than this-it is an
introduction to Latin as a language. It preparas the student not
only to begin the study of Caesar, but, with proper giridance to
make remarkably ropid aad satisfactory propress in reading and
understanding Latin. The skill of the authors as teachers has
enabled them to secure these larger results without deviation from
the main line or increase of difficulties. The fundamental idea was

to combine the utmost practice with the minimum of theory, on
the pr1nc1ple that a thorough acquisit ion of theelement sof Latin
by the young learner must tbe more a pr ocess than a sciencia, more
the work of observation‚ comparison, and rmita ationt than the me· i
ohanical following of rules or the exorciso of analysis and conscious ³
inductiva reasoning. There are therefore abundant and varied r
exercises on the forms and more important constructione of the i
language. The shilful choioe of words has made it possible to γ
provide exercises that are in themselves interesting. The colloquia
(simple Latin dialogues), the extracts for translation, introduced
as early as possible, and the mode of treatment throughout are
made to impert attractiveness, freshness, and variety, though there

is no sacrifice of rigorous seientifie method. Even if the time
allowed for Latin the first year is quite limited, teachers may still
be able to carry classes through the book by omitting certain de-
taohable portions of the course. Provision has been made for the
practical use of Latin in oral teaching.

Note the testimony of those who have used tt.
