THE AENEID, V11. 59

Besides these comes Camilla of the Volscian race,
leading a band of knights and squadrons gleaming

in bronze, a warrior maid, lter woman's hands not
wonted to the distafl and basket of Minerva, but, 805
maid as she was, used to endure stern combats and to
outstrip the winds by speed of foot. She could skim
along the top of a field ol grain untouched by the
sickle, and leave the tendet ears unerushed by her
tread ; or, over mid-sea poised on the swelling-waveS, 810
she could speed on her way, nor dip in the sea her
flying feet. Her, all the youth, pouring out from
home and holds, and throngs ol women see with
wonder, ‘and follow with their eyes as she goeS‚ open·
mouthed‚ with souls awostruck to see how the pride

of royal purple veils her smooth shoulders; how a 815
clasp of gold confines her hair, how she bears a
Lycian quiver and shepherd’s pike ol myrtle-wood,
tipped with point of iron.
